# CLI-based Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple CLI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++.

## Description
The game uses field coordinates similar to chess, with rows represented by letters and columns by numbers.  
The computer's moves are pseudo-random and do not implement any strategy.  
Invalid user input currently leads to an assertion failure.

## Purpose
This project was created for practice, focusing on:
- Game logic implementation
- Working with arrays and functions
- User input handling in a CLI environment
